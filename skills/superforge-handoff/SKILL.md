# Superforge Handoff — Cross-Model Session Transition Protocol

Use this skill when the work must continue in a **different tool or model**, most
often because credits or a usage limit are about to run out. It writes a
structured capsule to `.handoff/`, commits it, and pushes it, so whatever reads
the repository next can resume.

**Not for continuing inside Claude Code.** A long thread is handled by automatic
compaction, `/compact <what to keep>`, or `/clear` plus `docs/`; a later Claude
Code session reads `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` on its own. Writing a capsule there
spends tokens to restate what is already on disk.

**Run it early.** Writing the capsule costs tokens too. Start while there is
budget left to finish and push it, not on the last message before the limit.

---

## 1. Triggering Handoff (`/handoff` or `/superforge-handoff`)

1. Ensure directory `.handoff/` exists.
2. Create capsule file: `.handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.
3. Populate the **Resume Capsule** (under 80 lines):
   - Project & Passphrase (`<repo>: <catchy phrase>`)
   - Objective & Verified State
   - Running Processes & Active Ports
   - **The `docs/` ledger** — see below. This is the part that carries the
     decisions; without it the capsule carries the conversation instead
   - Immediate Next Steps
   - Files to Read First

### The `docs/` ledger — do not skip this

**List every file in `docs/`, not a summary of them.** One row each, read from
the file's own header block:

```markdown
## docs/
| File | Status | Last updated | Open questions |
|---|---|---|---|
| superforge.md | agreed | 2026-07-29 | — （会話=日本語 / ファイル=英語） |
| product-idea.md | agreed | 2026-07-30 | none |
| business-model.md | draft | 2026-07-31 | pricing tier 3 undecided |
| design.md + design.html | agreed | 2026-07-31 | — |
| accessibility.md | draft | 2026-07-29 | 3 criteria not assessed |
| verification.md | — | — | **not run yet** |
| security.md | FINDINGS-OPEN | 2026-07-31 | 1 High 未対応 |
| ship-readiness.md | — | — | **not run yet** |
| failforward.md | 6 entries | 2026-07-31 | 1 mitigation, cause still unknown |
```

Five rules that make this worth writing:

- **`superforge.md` goes first, and its language settings travel with it.**
  A resumed session that starts replying in the wrong language has lost
  something the user set explicitly, and will be corrected manually every time.
- **A file that does not exist gets a row saying so.** "verification.md — not
  run yet" is the single most useful line in the capsule, because it tells the
  next session what has *not* been proven. A missing row reads as "handled."
- **Copy the `Status` and `Last updated` from each file's own header**, not from
  memory. A capsule that claims `agreed` for something still marked `draft` is
  worse than no capsule.
- **Carry every `## Open questions` section forward.** Those are exactly the
  decisions an unattended run is allowed to make with a logged default —
  losing them means the next session either re-asks or re-decides silently.
- **`failforward.md` is the one row that is a count, not a status.** Note the
  number of entries and, specifically, any mitigation shipped without a root
  cause — an open failure the next session would otherwise rediscover the hard
  way.

The capsule **points at** these files rather than restating them. That is what
keeps it under 80 lines while losing nothing.

4. **Commit and push** — the step that makes the capsule exist for anyone else:
   - Commit the capsule *and* any finished, verified work it describes. Never
     commit a secret; if one is staged, stop and route to `superforge-secure`.
   - If `.handoff/` is git-ignored, add it with `git add -f`.
   - Push to the current working branch, never the default branch. Retry a
     network failure; if the push still fails, say so plainly — an unpushed
     capsule in a cloud session is lost when the container is reclaimed, and
     no other tool can read it.
   - Put the branch name and commit hash in the resume prompt.

5. Output the copy-paste-ready **Chat Resume Prompt**:

~~~text
次の作業を再開してください。

Project: <repo>
Branch: <branch> @ <commit>
Handoff file: .handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md
Goal: <Goal>
State: <Verified state>
Next: <Immediate next step>
Read first: <Files to read>

上記のNextから開始してください。
~~~

Show the prompt even when the push succeeded: it is the user's copy if the
repository is unreachable from the next tool.

## 2. Resuming Session

When a session opens with a Resume Capsule, pull the named branch, read the
indicated file in `.handoff/`, and jump straight to `Next` without asking
redundant background questions.

---

## 3. Prevent the emergency: push at every checkpoint

A handoff written after the limit is hit is too late — the work that matters is
whatever was never pushed. In a cloud session (Claude Code on the web) that work
exists only in a temporary container. The durable fix is a project rule, not this
skill: commit and push at each verified checkpoint. A `CLAUDE.md` rule and an
optional Stop hook that does it automatically →
**`references/checkpoint-push.md`**. Offer it once when a project has neither.

---

## Artifact

The capsule in `.handoff/` is the artifact. Before writing it, make sure every
skill that ran this session has already written its own `docs/` file — the
capsule points at those files rather than restating them, which is what keeps
it under 80 lines.

**A capsule written without reading `docs/` is a summary of the conversation,
which is the one thing the conversation already was.** The value of this skill
is entirely in the ledger: what was decided, where it is written down, what is
still open, and what was never run.

## Deeper reference

**`references/external-agents.md`** — the other direction of handoff: packaging
work so somebody else's agent runs it **without you**, on their machine, and
returns a pull request. Devin is the reference case and the shape generalises.
Covers the one-line tools question to ask once and record in `docs/superforge.md`,
the routing test (*is the value in you being there?*), what belongs in Knowledge
versus a Playbook versus repo setup, the brief to **generate rather than describe**,
what to run on the PR when it comes back, and the honest limit — handing work out
does not make you faster at reviewing it.

The test worth remembering even if you never read the file: **a task too vague to
hand to Devin is too vague to run unattended anywhere.** `docs/plan.md` already
carries one outcome, a proof line, and a file list per task; that *is* the brief.

## Delegate when a sharper skill is installed

`cross-model-handoff:handoff`, `handoff-setup` (tool-agnostic notes) ·
`memory` (long-term facts worth keeping beyond this project).
